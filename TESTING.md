- [ ] Adult counter increments/decrements
- [ ] Children counter increments/decrements
- [ ] Counters cannot go below 0
- [ ] Submit button works
- [ ] Data is saved correctly
- [ ] Success screen appears
- [ ] Auto-redirect to start works (3 seconds)

### Check-Out Flow
- [ ] Scanning same wristband detects active scan

- [ ] All required fields are present

### Error Handling
- [ ] NFC not supported shows error message
- [ ] Failed scan shows error message
- [ ] Network errors show appropriate message
- [ ] Validation errors show clear messages
- [ ] All error messages are in Dutch

## üîç Edge Cases

### Unusual Scenarios
- [ ] Scanning a wristband that was never checked in (should create new entry)
- [ ] Scanning a wristband that was already checked out (should create new entry)
- [ ] Submitting with 0 adults and 0 children (should be disabled)
- [ ] Very long NFC IDs are handled correctly
- [ ] Special characters in NFC IDs work
- [ ] Rapid consecutive scans don't cause issues
- [ ] Offline mode error handling

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Concurrent scans don't corrupt data
- [ ] Large JSON files (100+ entries) load correctly
- [ ] Date/time is accurate (check timezone)
- [ ] Entry time always comes before exit time

## üìä Performance

### Speed
- [ ] Scan detection is quick (<2 seconds)
- [ ] Page transitions are smooth
- [ ] API responses are fast (<500ms)
- [ ] No lag when incrementing counters
- [ ] Auto-redirect timing is accurate

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Application doesn't crash with many scans
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] CPU usage is low during idle
- [ ] No memory leaks over time

## üéì User Acceptance Testing
